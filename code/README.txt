Todo:
 - need to provide a batch oriented solution to reading in the replication updates from the musicbrains ftp server
 - need to build a bus module to handle things like the batch replication update
 - need to build a bots module that will use gridgain as the messaging topology fabric
 - need to upgrade jbpm3 which means i need to investigate building my own SpringModules for jbpm, since the newer versions of jBPM are fantastic and the old SpringModules jbpmTemplate's broken.
